# üéÆ react-native-video-zoom-control

VideoPlayer for the React Native `<Video/>` component at [react-native-video][15].

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**
>
> We're only supporting the beta version of `react-native-video`. Since it looks stable enough except for the subtitles (which might still be a WIP at the time of writing), we're already using it in production at http://englishdiscoveries.net/

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

This package contains a simple set of GUI controls that work with the [react-native-video][15] `<Video>` component.
- [x] `react-native-reanimated`
- [x] Back Button
- [x] Volume bar
- [x] Fullscreen button
- [x] Play/Pause button
- [x] Rewind/Forward buttons
- [x] Seekbar
- [x] Title
- [x] Timer
- [x] Video Zoom feature
- [x] Video Resolution controls


By default, tapping the screen anywhere will show the player controls. After 15s the controls disappear. Double tapping will toggle fullscreen.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Run `yarn add react-native-video react-native-media-console`

Then follow installation instructions from [react-native-video][15].

If you are using `react-native-reanimated`, then you can use `yarn add @react-native-media-console/reanimated`

> **üöß WARNING**
>
> You need react-native-video > 6.0.0 in order to use this library.

## üõ† Usage

The `<VideoPlayer>` component follows the API of the `<Video>` component at [react-native-video][15]. It also takes a number of additional props which are outlined in the [API](#-api) section.

```javascript
import VideoPlayer from 'react-native-media-console';
import {useAnimations} from '@react-native-media-console/reanimated';

<VideoPlayer
    useAnimations={useAnimations}
    source={{uri: 'https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4'}}
    navigator={props.navigator}
    videoUrls={[
      'https://example.com/video-low.mp4',
      'https://example.com/video-medium.mp4',
      'https://example.com/video-high.mp4',
    ]}
    selectResolutionCallback={(resolution) => console.log('Selected resolution:', resolution)}
/>;
```

To play a local file, use require syntax like so:

```js
<VideoPlayer source={require('path/to/file')}/>
```

## üß™ API

The `<VideoPlayer>` component can take a number of inputs to customize it as needed. They are outlined below:
